    <h1>Aziz Alangari</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm a writer and early crypto adopter. I purchased my first Bitcoin in 2016 as a sophomore in college and tweeted about it. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I worked as a content writer for Uber pre-IPO, did marketing for Filecoin, crafted crypto memes for Blockchain.com's CEO, and did plenty of PR, writing, and marketing for many crypto companies during my time at Wachsman. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I run a consultancy where I work with the Saudi Central Bank and the Capital Market Authority on everything Web3-related. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I write a weekly Substack newsletter that primarily discusses niche Saudi culture. Unconventionally, I have an active TikTok account which I find a lot of joy in. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I graduated from Riyadh Schools (Muqarrarat), Chapman University (BA), and Carnegie Mellon (MA). </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm Saudi born & raised; and spent the majority of my adult life between New York, NY and Los Angeles, CA.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of crypto and writing, I enjoy spending time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. </p>
