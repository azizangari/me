    <h1>Aziz Alangari</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm a writer and early crypto adopter. I worked at Uber pre-IPO, did marketing for Filecoin, crafted crypto memes for Blockchain.com's CEO, and did plenty of PR, writing, and marketing for several crypto companies during my time at Wachsman. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I like to follow my curiosity, not my passion. This made me buy my first Bitcoin in 2016, as a sophomore in college. I tweeted about it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I run a Riyadh-based consultancy where I work with the Saudi Central Bank and the Capital Market Authority on everything Web3-related. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I write a weekly Substack newsletter that discusses niche Saudi culture. Unconventionally, I have an active TikTok account which I find a lot of joy in. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I graduated from Riyadh Schools (Muqarrarat), Chapman University (BA), and Carnegie Mellon (MA). </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm 100% Saudi, from Tharmadah, with most of my maternal blood originating in Unaizah, Qassim; I spent the majority of my adult life between New York and Los Angeles</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">My two favorite places to visit are Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. </p>
