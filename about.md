I am a researcher at [vac](https://vac.dev/) ([status](https://status.im)) focusing on messaging protocols and distributed systems. I also work on [ens](https://ens.domains) as a developer. In my free-time I write a newsletter on distributed systems over at [substack](https://decanus.substack.com/). Additionally, all my research can be found in a [repository](https://github.com/decanus/research) on github.

*Previously:*

Software developer at [brack.ch](https://brack.ch).
