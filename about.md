I am research at [vac](https://vac.dev/) ([status](https://status.im)) focusing on distributed messaging protocols, and a developer at [ens](https://ens.domains). In my free-time I write a newsletter on distributed systems on [substack](https://decanus.substack.com/). Additionally, all my research can be found in a [repository](https://github.com/decanus/research) on github.
