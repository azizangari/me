# Hey!

I am a researcher at [vac](https://vac.dev). I am interested in distributed systems and write a [newsletter](https://distsys.substack.com/) on them.
I try to do my research transparently on [github](github.com/decanus/research).

*Selected talks:*

[Reliable Messaging over Whisper at Web3 Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMPw0dNyNmM) (2019)

[Ultralight Beam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxEYV3fZ6Pk) (2020)
